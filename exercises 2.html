1. Escaping
<h1> is a main heading on a page. It cannot be linked with other elements
    as it will cause confusion users and developers.
    Search engines rely on the proper use of headings to understand the structure and content of a page. Using headings correctly, 
    including a single <h1> on a page, is important for SEO

      EXAMPLE  <h1> this will be a heading</h1>

2. Comments
anything made within this element will be ignored by the browser and 
comments can span multiple lines
EXAMPLE <!-- comments made by the developer, this will not be visible to 
the public-->

3. Headlines
H1 Represents the main title of the page and should be used only once. 
It should be a concise summary of the page's content. 
H2: Used for major sections or chapters within the page. Each H2 should
introduce a distinct topic related to the overall page content. 
H3: Used to divide content within an H2 section. Think of it as a 
subsection of an H2 topic. 
H4, H5, H6:
Used for further levels of sub-division within H3, H4, and H5 sections,
respectively. These are less frequently used but are helpful for very
 detailed or complex content.
