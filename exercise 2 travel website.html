                <h3>TURBOS</h3>  
                <p>A forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine's power 
                    output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber.
                    While all turbos function similarly, there are different types, such as single,
                     twin, and variable geometry turbos, each with its own characteristics and 
                     applications.
                  </p> 
                  <p>Turbos are distinguished from superchargers in that a turbo is powered 
                    by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, whereas a supercharger is mechanically
                     powered usually by a belt from the engine's crankshaft</p>
