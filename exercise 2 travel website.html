        <h3>TURBOS</h3>
        <p>A forced induction device that increases an internal combustion engine's power
            output by forcing extra air into the combustion chamber.
            While all turbos function similarly, there are different types, such as single,
            twin, and variable geometry turbos, each with its own characteristics and
            applications.
        </p>
        <p>Turbos are distinguished from superchargers in that a turbo is powered
            by the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases, whereas a supercharger is mechanically
            powered usually by a belt from the engine's crankshaft</p>
