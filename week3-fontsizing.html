<h2>Font Sizing</h2>
        <h3> PX </h3>
        <p>A CSS pixel "px" is a unit of length in CSS, distinct from a physical device
             pixel. It is formally defined as 1/96th of a CSS inch.
             This definition aims to provide a consistent visual size for web
             content across various devices with differing pixel densities (DPI).
             </p>
            </div>
      <div id="PT">
        <style>
            #PT {font-size: 16pt;
            }
        </style>
        <h3>PT</h3>
        <p>In CSS, "pt" stands for points, an absolute length unit primarily used in print media.
            Definition:
            A point is a fixed-size unit of measurement, traditionally used in typography and print design.
            One point is defined as 1/72 of an inch. 
            In the context of CSS, using pt for font sizes or element dimensions means setting a size that
            corresponds directly to this fixed physical measurement,
            as if it were to be printed on paper.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="EM">
        <style>
            #EM {font-size: 16px;
                line-height: 2em;
            }
        </style>
        <h3>EM</h3>
        <p>In CSS, "em" is a unit of measurement which indicates size relative to the size of the font.
            1em means "equal to the current font size", and 2em means 2 times the current font size.
            When em units are applied to nested elements, their values can compound. For example, if a parent has font-size: 16px;
            and a child has font-size: 1.5em;, the child's font size will be 24px. If a grandchild then has font-size: 1.5em;
            Its size will be 1.5 * 24px = 36px. This cascading effect requires careful management in deeply nested structures. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div id="REM">
        <style>
            #REM {font-size: 1rem;
                }
        </style>
        <h3>REM</h3>
        <p>In CSS, "rem" stands for "root em". It is a relative unit of measurement that represents 
            the font size of the root element of a document,which is the html element.
            In most browsers, the default font size of the html element is 16px. Therefore, by default, 1rem equals 16px.
